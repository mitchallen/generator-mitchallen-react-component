> react component project generator

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-mitchallen-react-component using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

__Note:__ You may need to preface ```npm install -g``` commands with ```sudo```.

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-mitchallen-react-component
```

### Create and Generate Project

Then generate your new project:

```bash
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
yo mitchallen-react-component
```

### React peer dependency

Now __react__ is only installed as a peer dependency. It is assumed that whatever app the component is dropped into will install react.  This avoid errors with some libraries that won't compile if two versions of react are found in the same project.  

Avoid installing react locally to avoid any future conflicts. To run the tests you may need to install react globally, or push to a ci server that installs react before running your tests.  The generated CircleCI script is setup to do that.

## Continuous Integration Support

There seems to be issues running [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) under [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org). So I've made the following changes:

* Added support for [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)
  * Generated projects will now create the following hidden folder and file:
    * ```.circleci/config.yml```
    * You can see it on a Mac/Linux with: ```ls -la```
* The badge and link generated in the README now point to your project on CircleCI
* You are now prompted for your CircleCI username instead of your Travis CI username
* A ```.travis.yml``` file is no longer generated
* You can track my bug report here:  
  * https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/8265
* When resolved I'll restore support for Travis CI

## Testing

### Install Test Framework

To run the generator tests you will need to globally install __jest__ (http://facebook.github.io/jest/).

```bash
npm install -g jest jest-cli
```

To test, go to the root folder and type:

    npm test
